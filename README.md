# BigIdeasProject
Overview of program:
We created a simple program that takes user input and outputs a response depending on the age that was entered. For example, if the user enters an age between 18-50 the output will be "You are an 
adult." It will not work if strings are entered and will print an errort message if the user does not enter a number in the acceptable range. 

We chose to follow the ISC license for this program which allows for the free use of this code to others. This gives users the opportunity to modify or expand on our code.
The COC is Contributor Covenant which ensures users will create a safe and inclusive community.
